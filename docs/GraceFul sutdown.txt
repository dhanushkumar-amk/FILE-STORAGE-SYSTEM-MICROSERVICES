🔄 Graceful Shutdown Simple Explanation:
What is it?
Graceful shutdown is like politely closing a door instead of slamming it shut.
Without Graceful Shutdown (BAD) ❌
bash# Server gets killed immediately
kill -9 [process_id]
Results:

User uploading 500MB file → File corrupted
Database saving file metadata → Data lost
Redis storing session → Session broken
Active downloads → Connections dropped

With Graceful Shutdown (GOOD) ✅
javascript// Server says: "I'm shutting down, but let me finish current work first"
process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  console.log('Finishing current uploads...')
  // Complete active file uploads
  // Save pending data
  // Close connections properly
  process.exit(0)
})
🎯 Real Examples in Your File Storage System:
1. File Upload Scenario
👤 User: Uploading 100MB video file (50% complete)
🔄 Server: Receives shutdown signal
✅ Graceful: "Wait, let me finish this upload first"
❌ Ungraceful: "Bye!" → User loses 50MB of upload progress
2. Database Transaction
📝 User: Creating share link for file
💾 Database: Writing permissions, updating metadata
🔄 Server: Shutdown signal received
✅ Graceful: Complete transaction, then shutdown
❌ Ungraceful: Transaction left half-done → corrupted permissions
3. Production Deployment
🚀 DevOps: Deploying new version
📊 Load Balancer: Removing server from pool
✅ Graceful: Finish serving current requests, then shutdown
❌ Ungraceful: Drop all active users immediately
🛡️ Why Critical for Enterprise Systems?

Data Protection: No corrupted files or lost uploads
User Experience: No sudden disconnections
Compliance: Audit logs complete properly
Zero Downtime: Deployments without user impact
Resource Management: Clean database/Redis connections


/ =============================================
// WHY GRACEFUL SHUTDOWN IS CRITICAL FOR FILE STORAGE
// =============================================

/*
1. DATA INTEGRITY:
   - Files being uploaded won't get corrupted
   - Database transactions complete properly
   - Metadata stays consistent

2. USER EXPERIENCE:
   - Users get proper error messages
   - No lost work from sudden disconnections
   - Uploads can resume if designed properly

3. RESOURCE CLEANUP:
   - Database connections closed properly
   - Temporary files removed
   - Memory freed correctly

4. PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
   - Docker containers shutdown cleanly
   - Load balancers get proper health status
   - Zero-downtime deployments possible

5. COMPLIANCE:
   - Audit logs written completely
   - No partial transactions in compliance logs
   - Data protection regulations followed

// =============================================
// WHEN GRACEFUL SHUTDOWN IS TRIGGERED
// =============================================

/*
SIGTERM (most common):
- Docker stop command
- Kubernetes pod termination
- PM2 restart
- Heroku dyno restart
- Load balancer removing server

SIGINT:
- Ctrl+C in terminal
- IDE stop button
- Manual interruption

SIGUSR2:
- Nodemon restart
- Development hot reload
- Manual restart signals

Production scenarios:
- Server maintenance
- Code deployments
- Auto-scaling down
- Health check failures
- Resource constraints
